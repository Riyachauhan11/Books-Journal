Books Journal is a web application that allows users to maintain a personal reading log by recording reviews of books they've read. With a clean and intuitive interface, users can:

- Add books by searching with an ISBN
- Rate and review each book
- Log the completion date
- Sort their library by title, rating, or completion date
- Edit or delete any entry with ease

This project integrates the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) to fetch book details, making the experience fast and user-friendly.
